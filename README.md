Project: Nike Stock Management App

A command-line Python application that allows users to manage a stock inventory of Nike shoes.

Features:

- Add and save new shoe entries
- View all current inventory in a table
- Restock the lowest-quantity item
- Search for shoes by product code
- Calculate and display value per item
- Identify the product with the highest stock level
